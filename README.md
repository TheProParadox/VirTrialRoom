## Project: Interactive Virtual Fashion Trial Room

### Description:
The Interactive Virtual Fashion Trial Room is an advanced image-based virtual try-on system that allows users to visualize clothing items on their own photos with high fidelity. This project aims to create a realistic and user-friendly virtual try-on experience. We aim to build a high resolution try-on with accurate clothing warping, detail preservation, size adjustment, and style options (tucked/untucked), retaining human characteristics and offers an interactive UI for easy clothing selection and visualization.

### Tech Stack:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - scikit-learn for model evaluation
  - pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation/visualization, metric evaluation with existing
- Dataset:

### Start:
1. **(Week 1-3) Literature Review and Capability Assessment:**
   a. Review recent papers on virtual try-on systems [List of papers]
   b. Analyze 2D vs 3D approaches and their trade-offs according to time, resources
   c. Identify key features and capabilities for our system
   d. Decide on primary approach (2D, 3D, or hybrid) based on review.
